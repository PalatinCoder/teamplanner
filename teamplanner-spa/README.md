## Overview

This is the PWA to use the teamplanner API. It is served from the same server as the API itself.

## Configuration

### Custom Logo
To use a custom logo bind-mount your logo to `/dist/logo-default.png`

### Custom Title
not yet, sorry.

## Limitations

Currently there is no UI for the endpoints to set matches and teammates, so you have to set these manually.
